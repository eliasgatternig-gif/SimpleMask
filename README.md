# Simple Mask

**A lightweight tool to mask parts of images directly in the Editor. Works on Mobile & Web!**

Simple Mask solves the problem of "clutter" when creating image occlusions. Instead of generating dozens of new notes for a single image, it lets you draw masks directly onto your *existing* pictures.

It is **non-destructive**: it never modifies your original image file. Instead, it saves the masks as lightweight code hidden behind the image.

### Key Features
* **📱 Works Everywhere:** Because Simple Mask uses standard code, your masks work perfectly on **AnkiDroid**, **AnkiMobile** (iOS), and **AnkiWeb**.
* **👆 Hide All, Reveal One:** Tap a specific mask to peek behind it.
* **🔓 Instant Reveal:** Simply press the standard **Show Answer** button to make *all* masks disappear at once.
* **🎨 Flexible Shapes:** Draw Rectangles, Circles, Triangles, and Hexagons in multiple colors.

### How to Use
1.  **Select an Image:** Click on any image in the "Add" or "Edit" window.
2.  **Draw:** Select the **Pen** tool and drag to cover the text or diagram.
3.  **Review:** On your phone or computer, the answer will be covered. Tap a mask to reveal just that part, or press **Show Answer** to reveal everything.

### Tools & Shortcuts
* 🖊️ **Draw Shape** (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) — Activates drawing mode.
* ✂️ **Eraser** (`Ctrl+Alt+D`) — Click on any mask to remove it.
* 👁️ **Preview** (`Ctrl+Alt+V`) — A quick way to check your masks in the editor.
* ⚙️ **Settings** — Change mask color and opacity via the menu.
